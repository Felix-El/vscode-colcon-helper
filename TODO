Thoughts on future enhancements:
    contributions:
        - problemMatcher
        - debugger for C++/Python using ROS2 launch configuration
        - current colcon workspace configuration in separate json
        - whitelist/blackelist for colcon packages
            build/test only and build/test except
        - command for create new Python/C++ package
        - Force set base configuration settings for workspace

    - Automatic detection if current workspace is colcon-workspace
    - Tests
    - Separate info and debug output levels
    - Automatically update environment if package is added or deleted
    - spinning wheel in status bar indicating that environment is updating right now
        - by now there is notification after refreshing complete
    - multiple colcon workspace include
    - update environment after clean/build
    - path to colcon executable
    - Will there be problems with Windows path separators? Must check
    - Add posiibility to Build, Test, Run to be launched as commands
        - Should be outputted to Output Channel
    - Option whether provide run command or not. For workspace with libraries
